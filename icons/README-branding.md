# nuxt-atomic • Branding

Three-color vector identity aligned with the Nuxt/Vue aesthetic.

- **Palette**  
  - Green: `#00DC82` (Nuxt green)  
  - Navy: `#020420` (Deep base)
  - Blue: `#3740b3` (Atomic)

- **Files**
  - `nuxt-atomic-icon.svg` – square icon/mark (transparent background)
  - `nuxt-atomic-logo-horizontal.svg` – logotype with wordmark
  - `nuxt-atomic-logo-stacked.svg` – stacked lockup

- **Usage**
  - Prefer the **icon** at 24–256px (favicons, badges, avatars).
  - Use **horizontal** for headers and READMEs.
  - Use **stacked** on product pages or social cards.
  - Background is transparent; use on light or dark surfaces.
  - Keep at least **1× stroke width** of clearspace around the mark.

- **Do**
  - Keep to **two colors** (green + navy) for brand consistency.
  - Scale freely; SVGs are fully vector.

- **Don’t**
  - Add shadows/gradients beyond the two core brand colors.
  - Distort the triangle/orbit proportions.

## Figma / Outline Note
Text in the wordmarks uses system fonts. If you need fully outlined type, convert to paths in Figma/Illustrator (or ask me to export outlined variants).
